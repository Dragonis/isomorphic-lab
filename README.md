## Isomorphic Lab

This repo is being used to experiment with writing isomorphic JavaScript apps
with [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/),
[react-router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router) and
[express](https://github.com/strongloop/express).

It uses the trunk version of [newforms](https://github.com/insin/newforms) for
form display and validation on both ends - this could be done manually with any
component which can populate its form fields and display error messages based on
props and state, though.
