## Isomorphic Lab

This repo is being used to experiment with writing isomorphic JavaScript apps
with [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/),
[react-router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router) and
[express](https://github.com/strongloop/express).

It uses [newforms](https://github.com/insin/newforms) for form display and
validation on both ends - this could be done manually with any component which
can populate its form fields and display error messages based on its props and
state, though.
